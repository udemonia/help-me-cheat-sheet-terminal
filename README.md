# Help Me

A simple bash script to get some help without ever leaving the terminal (this probably looks much more impressive than it is üòù)

## Installation

clone/fork the repo or simply copy the code in the .sh file

Add an alias to your `~/.bash_profile` I picked 'helpme'

## Using the Script

The first word after your alias is for the programming language you have a question about, all the rest of the words will be concatenated with an + for the query

e.g.

-helpme python decorators

-helpme javascript do while loops

-helpme python magic methods
